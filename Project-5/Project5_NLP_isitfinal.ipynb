The accolades she has received include nominations for two Screen Actors Guild Awards, a Critics\\' Choice Movie Award, and an Independent Spirit Award.\\nAfter appearing in television commercials, her first starring role in a feature film came with the teen comedy License to Drive (1988), followed by the critically acclaimed film Drugstore Cowboy (1989). She then played supporting roles on the television series Twin Peaks (1991), and in films such as Six Degrees of Separation (1993) and Swingers (1996). She gained critical praise for her role as \"Rollergirl\" in the film Boogie Nights (1997). This led to major roles in the comedy films Bowfinger and Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (both 1999).\\nGraham had leading roles in Say It Isn\\'t So (2001) and From Hell (2001), and continued to play supporting roles in the films Mary (2005); The Hangover (2009) and its sequel, The Hangover Part III (2013); At Any Price (2012); and Horns (2013). She has had roles on television series such as Scrubs (2004) and Californication (2014). In 2018, Graham made her directorial debut with the comedy Half Magic.\\nGraham is a public advocate for Children International and supported the climate change campaign Global Cool in 2007.\\n\\nEarly life\\nGraham was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The elder of two children, her younger sister Aimee Graham is also an actress and writer. Her mother Joan (née Bransfield) is a teacher and author of children\\'s books, and her father James Graham is a retired FBI agent. Her family relocated repeatedly before moving to Agoura Hills, California when she was nine. She was introduced to acting during a school production of The Wizard of Oz.\\nAfter high school, Graham enrolled in extension classes at the University of California, Los Angeles, where she studied English for two years. Against her parents\\' wishes, Graham withdrew from UCLA to pursue acting full time.\\n\\nCareer\\nEarly work (1984–1988)\\nGraham\\'s first film appearance was an uncredited cameo in Mrs. Soffel (1984). Her first credited film appearance was in the television film Student Exchange. In 1986, she appeared on a special \"Teen Week\" episode of the NBC game show Scrabble. Then she appeared in numerous television commercials, and an episode of the sitcom Growing Pains in 1987. Her first high-profile starring role came in the Corey Haim/Corey Feldman vehicle License to Drive (1988), as a popular girl named Mercedes Lane, who serves as the love interest of Haim\\'s character. Her efforts won her a Young Artist Award nomination in the Best Young Actress in a Motion Picture Comedy or Fantasy category. Her strict parents forbade her to accept a role in the black comedy Heathers (1988), which had an expletive-rich script. The same year, she had an uncredited appearance as Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger\\'s mother in flashbacks in their film, Twins.\\n\\nFrom Drugstore Cowboy to Swingers (1989–1996)\\nIn 1989, Graham was featured in Gus Van Sant\\'s Drugstore Cowboy as Nadine, a young, drug-addicted accomplice of the two main characters (played by Matt Dillon and Kelly Lynch). Her performance gave her career an initial boost and earned her a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actress. She rejected a steady role in a soap opera and a three-picture deal with a major studio because she thought it would be too restrictive. After Drugstore Cowboy, she appeared in Lawrence Kasdan\\'s dark comedy I Love You to Death (1990), alongside William Hurt and Keanu Reeves, and the rock-and-roll coming-of-age film Shout (1991), for which she received a nomination for the Young Artist Award for Best Actress Starring in a Motion Picture.\\nAfter Graham co-starred with Benicio del Toro in a Calvin Klein commercial directed by David Lynch, the director cast her as Annie Blackburn in Twin Peaks, where she appeared in the final six episodes. Following the show\\'s cancellation, Graham reprised the role of Blackburn in the 1992 prequel film Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me.\\nShe featured in Diggstown (1992), alongside James Woods; the well-received Six Degrees of Separation (1993), alongside Will Smith; and The Ballad of Little Jo (1993), alongside Ian McKellen before reteaming with Gus Van Sant for the critically panned film adaptation of Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, alongside Uma Thurman. The same year she co-starred as Mary Kennedy Taylor in Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle. In 1995, she starred as Jackie in the poorly received Desert Winds and guest-starred in an episode of the television series Fallen Angels. She had a small but important role in Swingers (1996), where she played Lorraine, Jon Favreau\\'s love interest. She also played a small role as Maggie Bowen in Entertaining Angels: The Dorothy Day Story (1996).\\n\\nWider industry and public recognition (1997–2003)\\nGraham\\'s popularity significantly increased after playing a young porn star in the critically acclaimed film Boogie Nights (1997). The cast received a nomination for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. The same year, she also starred in the Gregg Araki film Nowhere, and had a cameo in the horror hit Scream 2 as a fictionalised version of herself, portraying Casey Becker in the film within a film Stab. She was subsequently cast in Two Girls and a Guy (1998), a film mainly based upon dialogue between the characters, shot in 11 days, which co-starred Robert Downey Jr. and Natasha Gregson; and the sci-fi film Lost in Space, which was met with mostly negative reviews, and grossed $69,117,629 domestically on a production budget of $80 million. The cast was signed on for sequels that remain unmade.\\nShe starred as Felicity Shagwell in the sequel Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999), which was a box-office hit. Shagwell is one of her best-known roles and became a fan favorite. Her turn as Shagwell also earned her a nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Actress. She appeared in the music video for Lenny Kravitz\\'s cover of \"American Woman\". Also in 1999, Graham co-starred as Daisy in the movie Bowfinger, opposite Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy.\\nThe 2000 film Committed was her first starring vehicle. She played Joline, a devoted-beyond-reason young wife looking for the husband who left her. While the film itself received mixed reviews, the Rotten Tomatoes summary of critics felt that \"Graham shows she can play a central character\", but noted \"she\\'s not enough to make Committed successful\". The following year, she co-starred as Annie Matthews, an unhappily married woman, in Edward Burns\\' Sidewalks of New York. In 2002, she starred with Joseph Fiennes in Chen Kaige\\'s English-language debut film Killing Me Softly, which received overwhelmingly negative response from critics and a 0% at Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus being: \"Respected director Chen Kaige\\'s first English-language film is a spectacularly misguided erotic thriller, with ludicrous plot twists and cringe-worthy dialogue\". In 2009, the site also rated it No. 12 on the countdown of the worst films over the last ten years.\\nGraham\\'s other appearances in mainstream fare include playing a fictionalized version of the Jack the Ripper murder victim Mary Kelly in the film From Hell (2001), starring Johnny Depp; Anger Management (2003), starring Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson; the Farrelly Brothers comedy Say It Isn\\'t So (2001), opposite Sally Field; The Guru, co-starring Jimi Mistry, and Hope Springs (2003), co-starring Colin Firth.\\n\\nFocus on independent films and television (2004–2008)\\nFrom 2004 to 2008, Graham starred in several independent films Gray Matters, Broken, Adrift in Manhattan (all 2007), and Miss Conception (2008), most of which received generally negative reviews and went largely unnoticed at the box office. Her 2005 film Mary holds a 63% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, her first \"Fresh\" film since Bowfinger. The film premiered at the 2005 Venice Film Festival where it won the Special Jury Prize, as well as three smaller awards. The film also played at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival, Deauville Film Festival, and San Sebastián International Film Festival, and co-starred Juliette Binoche, Forest Whitaker, Marion Cotillard, and Matthew Modine. In 2006, she co-starred in Bobby as Angela; the film\\'s cast was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.\\nGraham also spoke about developing a comedy film titled The Accidental Virgin, which would have focused on \"female sexual confusion\", telling the story of a woman who has not had sex in a year. The film has not been made. She also stated she would be interested in directing in the future if it is \"something that, its burning in my mind that I need to do\".\\nOn television, Graham played herself in an episode of the TV series Sex and the City. She was given special guest-star status on nine episodes of Scrubs during its fourth season (2004–2005), and also appeared as George Michael Bluth\\'s ethics teacher in an episode of Arrested Development in 2004. She played Emily Sanders in Emily\\'s Reasons Why Not, but the sitcom was cancelled after airing only one episode.\\n\\nThe Hangover and after (2009–present)\\nIn 2009, Graham played the stripper with a heart of gold, Jade, in The Hangover, which was released to critical and box-office success. She won the role after Lindsay Lohan turned it down. Though she did not return for the sequel The Hangover Part II, she reprised her role in the final installment of the trilogy, The Hangover Part III. In 2010, she starred in Boogie Woogie, followed by roles in the unsuccessful films Father of Invention, 5 Days of War, Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer (all 2011), and About Cherry (2012). Graham was also credited for archive footage of her from Scream 2 re-used in Scream 4 (2011).\\nGraham voiced the character of Antonia Bayle in the online role-playing video game EverQuest 2.\\nShe played Meredith Crown in At Any Price, which stars Dennis Quaid and Zac Efron, and was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 69th Venice International Film Festival, and later screened as an official selection at the Telluride and Toronto Film Festivals. Other roles include mob lawyer Annette Stratton-Osborne in Behaving Badly and short story writer Mary Bellanova in My Dead Boyfriend (both 2014). She wrote a comedy screenplay called Half Magic, which in 2013 she stated she wanted to direct. She said the story focuses on \"these female friends and sexuality and about people having a sense of shame about sexuality and learning how to have a healthier attitude about it [...] It also deals with male/female relationships and sexism\". The film was released in 2018.\\nIn 2012, she was a member of the jury of the 15th Shanghai International Film Festival.\\nIn 2014, she starred in the second adaptation of the V. C. Andrews novel Flowers in the Attic on the Lifetime network. She played the character of Corrine Dollanganger, an evil mother who locks her four children in an attic to receive an inheritance from her dying father. Graham also appeared in two TV films sequels based on the V.C. Andrews\\' series: Petals on the Wind and If There Be Thorns, continuing to play the role of Corrine Dollanganger. She appeared in the final season of Californication as the mother of David Duchovny\\'s long-lost son.\\nIn 2018, she co-starred in the David Cross dark comedy series Bliss, which was released by the BritBox streaming service. It starred Stephen Mangan as Andrew, a fraudulent travel writer, who struggles to maintain long-term relationships with two partners, Kim (Graham) and Denise (Jo Hartley), who are not aware of one another.\\nIn 2023, Graham starred as Charlotte Sanders in the Netflix Christmas-themed film Best. Christmas. Ever! alongside Brandy Norwood, Jason Biggs and Matt Cedeño.\\nGraham wrote, directed, and starred in Chosen Family, which was set for release in 2024.\\n\\nActivism\\nBesides her acting work, Graham is also an activist who serves as a public advocate for the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Children International. She stated that what she likes about Children International is that \"you are helping a child have a better life. It\\'s great for that child to know that someone who lives in another country cares about them\". Graham works with the Cambodian Children\\'s Fund, also an NGO, which provides supplies and education, and campaigns to stop slavery. \"There\\'s a lot of human trafficking in Cambodia,\" Graham has said. \"Women are dying because they don\\'t have $15 to give birth in a hospital. The [Children\\'s Fund] provides free education, clean water and healthcare for communities... We\\'re creating future leaders who will be able to help themselves.\"\\nIn 2007 she supported the climate change campaign Global Cool and appeared in Shekhar Kapur\\'s short film Global Cool alongside Sienna Miller.\\n\\nIn the media\\nGraham is considered a sex symbol. She was ranked at number 40 in FHM\\'s 100 Sexiest Women in the World list in 2000, number 95 in 2001 list, number 97 in the 2002 list, number 74 in the 2005 list and at number 98 in 2006 list. In 2001, she was named one of the 50 Most Beautiful People by People. In 2003, she posed for a photoshoot by photographer Sam Jones during which she was levitated several feet into the air by a magician who later also sawed her in half. Also in 2003, Graham appeared on the cover of Time for an article titled \"The Science of Meditation\". To promote Emily\\'s Reasons Why Not, she posed for a LIFE cover story, printed weeks in advance of the assumed series schedule, referring to her as \"TV\\'s sexiest star\", which appeared in the January 27, 2006, issue.\\nGraham is often cast in sexual roles, including those of Felicity Shagwell (Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged Me), porn stars Rollergirl (Boogie Nights) and Sharonna (The Guru), prostitute Mary Kelly (From Hell), porn director Margaret (About Cherry), and stripper Jade (The Hangover and The Hangover, Part III). She stated she finds these types of roles and the issue of sexuality fascinating, and believes that \"our culture sends out mixed messages to women about sex. Are women supposed to be sexually alive people, or are we supposed to be \\'good\\' mothers who would never do those things?\" and that she likes \"the fact some of my roles maybe help people open their minds about the way they think about sex\".\\nIn 2005, Graham became the spokeswoman for the Garnier brand of hair care products.\\nIn 2017, Graham recounted a time in the early 2000s when Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein indirectly implied that he would give her a role of her choice if she slept with him. Later, Graham indicated she canceled a planned meeting with Weinstein at a hotel when a friend was unable to accompany her. Graham did not have further contact with Weinstein and she was never cast in any films he produced.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nGraham has been estranged from her parents in the past. Regarding the media\\'s perception of her relationship with her parents, she stated: \"I don\\'t really like to talk about my parents because I just feel that it gets misinterpreted in the press.\"\\nGraham has been practicing transcendental meditation since 1991 after being introduced to it by David Lynch. She has also expressed her dislike of reality television, stating in a 2007 interview: \"I think some of it, it seems strange – why do we all want to watch people be so miserable? Other people\\'s pain and misery – it seems kind of sad.\"\\nIn 1992, Graham dated James Woods, her co-star in the film Diggstown. She later dated rock star Adam Ant.\\nFrom 2008 to 2011, she was in a relationship with Israeli screenwriter Yaniv Raz. She also dated Heath Ledger.\\nShe has been dating John de Neufville since 2022.\\n\\nFilmography\\nFilm\\nTelevision\\nVideo games\\nMusic video\\nAwards and nominations\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\n\\nHeather Graham at IMDb\\nHeather Graham at the TCM Movie Database\\nHeather Graham at Rotten Tomatoes\\nHeather Graham at Metacritic'"

Graham is an American film editor and producer known for his work on Milk (2008), Steve Jobs (2015), Captain Marvel (2019), and No Time to Die (2021).\\nHe was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Film Editing for Milk and won a BAFTA Award for Best Editing for No Time to Die.\\n\\nCareer\\nIn 1999, Graham received a bachelor's degree in History and Film from New York University. His first editing credit was for The Last Minute (2001), an independent film that was written, directed, and edited by Stephen Norrington. Graham was initially hired to assist Norrington with editing, but ultimately shared the editing credit. Graham subsequently worked on two films with director Bryan Singer, X2 (2003) and Superman Returns (2006), both co-edited with John Ottman. Graham also edited the Singer-directed pilot for the television program House (2004).\\n\\nElliot Graham's editing for Gus Van Sant's 2008 film Milk was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing and for the American Cinema Editors Eddie Award. Several critics have written about the editing of Milk, which intermixes archival footage from the era of the film with footage of the actors.The challenge was to incorporate so many archival sequences without weighing the story down -- use too much, and the film could start to feel like a documentary. \\\"The trick with the stock footage was when to use it and how much of it to use,\\\" Graham says, pointing to the sequence in which Milk and his colleagues await the results of California's Proposition 6 vote as one that makes inventive use of historical records. Here Graham keeps cutting back and forth between news footage from Election Day, with person-on-the street interviews and poll numbers, to Sean Penn and the other actors sweating it out.\\n\\nFilmography (as editor)\\nThe director of each film is indicated in parentheses.\\n\\nThe Last Minute (Stephen Norrington, 2001; co-editor with Stephen Norrington)\\nX2 (Bryan Singer, 2003; co-editor with John Ottman)\\nThe Greatest Game Ever Played (Bill Paxton, 2005)\\nSuperman Returns (Bryan Singer, 2006; co-editor with John Ottman)\\n21 (Robert Luketic, 2008)\\nMilk (Gus Van Sant, 2008)\\nRestless (Gus Van Sant, 2011)\\nTrash (Stephen Daldry, 2014)\\nSteve Jobs (Danny Boyle, 2015)\\nMolly's Game (Aaron Sorkin, 2017)\\nCaptain Marvel (Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, 2019; co-editor with Debbie Berman)\\nNo Time to Die (Cary Joji Fukunaga, 2021; co-editor with Tom Cross)\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nElliot Graham at IMDb\\nKrickl, Tony (January 28, 2009). \\\"Claremont native happy to be part of the Oscar party\\\".

Peter Debruge from the Variety wrote: \\\"If Bailey is the film\\u2019s big discovery, then McCarthy is its no-brainer. Dolled up to look like Divine\\u2019s evil-stepsister in her glowing green lair, the comic star\\u2019s just delicious as the movie\\u2019s deep-sea villain. Her timing is impeccable, and though the part is virtually identical to the one Pat Carroll originated, she aces what\\u2019s demanded of these tricky remakes: Basically, McCarthy manages to hit every beat the super fans expect, while surprising with every pause and inflection.\\\"\\nMcCarthy starred in the film Genie written by Richard Curtis.

And I think just saying like, \\\"Can't we all just be kind to each other?\\\" and that gets a \\\"F\\u2014 you, lady,\\\" I don't know what to do.\\\"\\nIn August 2021, McCarthy joined the 40x40 campaign launched by Meghan Markle to mark her 40th birthday. 40x40 is a campaign that asks people around the world to spend 40 minutes of their time mentoring women reentering the workforce and combating the outsized economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women.\\n\\nFashion line\\nMcCarthy studied textiles at Southern Illinois University and was interested in a fashion career before she pursued her interests in acting.

Heard also served as a Human Rights Ambassador for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\\nHeard was married to actor Johnny Depp from 2015 to 2016. Afterward, the pair accused each other of domestic abuse and engaged in two lengthy and high-profile defamation cases, the Depp v. NGN trial where the court ruled that Depp engaged in domestic abuse against Heard, and the widely publicized Depp v. Heard trial, where she was found liable for defaming Depp.\\n\\nEarly life\\nAmber Laura Heard was born on April 22, 1986, in Austin, Texas, the middle child of three daughters of internet researcher Patricia Paige (n\\u00e9e Parsons; 1956\\u20132020) and construction company owner David Clinton Heard (born 1950).

Shortly after the screening, the film was pulled from release due to disagreements between its director and producers, and due to litigation. Heard was sued for $10 million for allegedly breaching performance and promotional obligations. The actress countersued, claiming the producers had violated a nudity rider in her contract. In September 2018, a settlement was reached, and the film was finally released. It received highly negative reviews, and Heard later stated that \\\"it was one of the most difficult movies to film and it has proven to continue to be difficult ... I can't say I did [the character] justice\\\". Jane Mulkerrins of The Daily Telegraph wrote that Heard provided \\\"a decent enough turn as the enigmatic [Nicola Six]\\\" that still could not save the adaptation, while Peter Sobczynski of RogerEbert.com said that she \\\"just does not project the kind of mystery and allure\\\" that the character requires. In 2019, Heard's performance in the film received a nomination for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress.\\n\\n2017\\u20132023: DC Extended Universe and other projects\\nIn 2017, Heard appeared as part of an ensemble cast in Lake Bell's indie comedy I Do... Until I Don't and joined the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) cast as Mera, a princess of an Atlantean kingdom, in the superhero film Justice League. She reprised the role the following year in Aquaman, which co-starred Jason Momoa and marked Heard's first major role in a studio film. She cited Mera's trait of being \\\"a strong, independent, self-possessed superhero in her own right\\\" as one of the reasons for her attraction to the role as well as Mera's rejection of being called Aquawoman instead of by her own name. Aquaman received mixed reviews. It was a commercial success, grossing over $1 billion. The Chicago Tribune's Michael Phillips and The Independent's Geoffrey Macnab respectively noted that Heard \\\"lends a blas\\u00e9 air of early '50s B-movie cheese\\\" and that she \\\"camps it up entertainingly\\\" as Mera. That same year, Heard was appointed global ambassador for cosmetics brand L'Or\\u00e9al Paris.\\nIn 2019, Heard had supporting roles in the independent dramas Her Smell and Gully. Her only project released in 2020 was The Stand, a miniseries based on Stephen King's novel of the same name. She played Nadine Cross, a school teacher who is among the few survivors of an apocalyptic plague. It premiered on CBS All Access in December 2020, with the series finale airing in February 2021. In 2021, Heard reprised her role as Mera in the superhero film Zack Snyder's Justice League, a director's cut of the 2017 film, for which she had also filmed new scenes.\\nHeard reprised her Mera role in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023), a sequel to Aquaman. An online petition to remove Heard from the film began following her ex-husband Depp's loss in his UK libel case and his replacement in the Fantastic Beasts films in 2020. Heard described the campaign as \\\"paid rumors and paid campaigns on social media\\\", and the film's co-producer, Peter Safran, confirmed that Heard would appear in the sequel. By the start of the 2022 Depp v. Heard trial in the US, the petition had reached 2 million signatures. Heard stated that she \\\"'fought really hard to stay in the movie' but that 'they didn't want to include me in the film' and only shot a 'very pared-down version' of her part\\\". Walter Hamada, a former DC Studios president, and James Wan, the film's director, attributed the reduction of Heard's role to the sequel's intention to focus on the relationship between Momoa and Patrick Wilson's characters.\\nFollowing the release of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom in 2023, several critics observed that, true to what Heard claimed in court, a number of her scenes seem to have been cut out from the film. One critic writing for Business Insider stated that \\\"[d]espite WB and Wan's claim, it's tough to believe there wasn't another version of the film where Mera teamed up with her husband to track down his brother and the trio confronted Black Manta.\\\" Another critic noted that \\\"Heard, a steely highlight of Aquaman, here feels as though her scenes were all added in post\\\" and that \\\"[g]iven the clunky way Mera is literally silenced in the movie... it's hard not to assume that someone important in the production considered her a liability and made a decision of profound, deeply disappointing cowardice: To treat her as radioactive.\\\" Echoing these sentiments, another critic wrote that \\\"the fact that Heard's role is so sloppy and awkward suggests this wasn't the plan all along. It truly looks as if someone erased her actual role and then tossed her into the movie at the last minute as an afterthought\\\" and further added that this is consistent with \\\"Heard's allegations of the film cutting her role from the original script\\\". In a more recent interview, Dolph Lundgren confirmed these observations by noting that \\\"the original script was great... I was a bigger part of it and Amber Heard was a bigger part of it\\\" while also lamenting that \\\"[t]he studio decided... to just reshoot a bunch of footage to try to rebuild a slightly different story line... I felt a little disappointed, but life goes on.\\\"\\nHeard's first role after the trial was in the film In the Fire, directed by Conor Allyn. The film premiered at the Taormina Film Fest in June 2023. It was released in October 2023.\\n\\nActivism\\nHeard traveled to the Mexico\\u2013United States border with Amnesty International and worked with the organization on a bilingual campaign to raise awareness about US immigration policies. She supported the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights' Stand Up for Human Rights campaign. Heard was one of the speakers at the United Nations' 9th Annual Social Good Summit in September 2018. In her talk, she highlighted the centrality of humans and significance of fairness and justice, as embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Ahead of the 70th anniversary of the declaration's drafting, Heard gave a speech at HagueTalks' Imagine the World We Want event in October 2018.\\nIn April 2018, Heard joined the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) on a multi-specialty medical mission to the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan as a goodwill ambassador. She henceforth partnered with SAMS to help finance treatment for children in the camp with thalassemia. In November 2018, she visited Smile Train's programs in Mexico, during which she met with children with cleft lip and cleft palate, their families, and doctors. In February 2019, Heard joined SAMS' mission to Lebanon to help Syrian refugees living in poverty, during which she visited informal settlements in Beqaa Valley. She also partnered with SAMS in raising funds for psychosocial and educational programs and vocational training for the women and children in these settlements.\\nIn November 2016, Heard appeared in a public service announcement (PSA) on domestic violence for the #GirlGaze Project. In the PSA, she spoke about the importance of making it easier for violence against women (VAW) survivors to come forward and self-advocate. She also highlighted the importance of taking responsibility for how VAW is handled and discussed in society. In a letter published in the December 2016 issue of Porter magazine, she spoke to \\\"every woman who is suffering in silence\\\", assuring them that they \\\"may not see us, but we are there. Your sisters are everywhere... and we are with you.\\\"\\nDuring The Economist's Pride and Prejudice event in March 2017, Heard highlighted the underrepresentation of LGBTQ characters in the Hollywood film industry. Referencing her own coming out story, she praised actresses that are candid about their sexuality and encouraged men in the industry to help \\\"challenge the status quo\\\". In August 2017, Heard produced a short video for the publication, in which she spoke about the gender pay gap and underrepresentation of women in the industry. In 2018, Heard became an ambassador for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), aiding the organization's advocacy for justice in gender issues.\\nIn August 2016, Heard pledged to donate her $7 million divorce settlement with Johnny Depp to the ACLU and Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA). In November 2016, she defended this pledge against an allegation from TMZ\\u2014despite Depp not having completed the payment to her\\u2014that she had not yet made the donations as pledged. CHLA included Heard in their \\\"Honor Roll of Donors\\\" list for the fiscal year 2017. Depp finished paying the full settlement to Heard in October 2018. On the Dutch talk show RTL Late Night in October 2018, Heard said she had donated $7 million to the ACLU and CHLA. As part of Depp v News Group Newspapers Ltd, Heard stated in a 2020 testimony that the settlement's full amount was donated to charity.\\nIn January 2021, the Daily Mail reported an allegation made by Depp's lawyers that Heard had yet to complete her donations. In response to this claim, Heard's lawyer stated that Heard intended to \\\"eventually fulfill her pledge\\\" but had \\\"been delayed in that goal because ... she has been forced to spend millions of dollars\\\" following Depp's lawsuit. During the 2022 Depp v. Heard trial, the corporate designee of CHLA testified that as of 2021, Heard had given the organization $250,000. The ACLU's chief operating officer testified in December 2021 that the organization expected to receive the money over a 10-year period. To that time, a total of $1.3 million had been donated to the ACLU in Heard's name between 2016 and 2018. Heard testified that defending the case had cost her more than $6 million in legal fees and that she planned to resume her donations when she could.\\nIn May 2019, Heard gave a speech on Capitol Hill in support of the SHIELD Act, discussing her experience with the nonconsensual leak of her private photos obtained via hacking as part of the 2014 celebrity nude photo leak. Heard wrote an op-ed in The New York Times in November 2019, deeming \\\"revenge porn\\\" an inappropriate label due to the lack of consent for the images' disclosure and emphasizing the importance of congressional legislation to protect privacy in light of state laws' failure. In the same month, Heard, together with Nico Tortorella and DC Comics, was awarded for \\\"their activism and commitment to disenfranchised youth\\\" by the Hetrick-Martin Institute. Prior to the 2020 United States presidential election, Heard appeared in an election ad created by artist Marilyn Minter in support of Planned Parenthood and participated in the VoteRiders #IDCheck Challenge on social media.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nHeard publicly came out in 2010, but has stated, \\\"I don't label myself one way or another \\u2013 I have had successful relationships with men and now a woman. I love who I love; it's the person that matters.\\\"\\nHeard was in a relationship with photographer Tasya van Ree from 2008 to 2012. Heard had her last name legally changed to van Ree during the relationship and reverted to her birth name in 2014. In 2009, Heard was arrested for misdemeanor domestic violence at Seattle\\u2013Tacoma International Airport, Washington, after allegedly hitting van Ree. Heard appeared the next day in King County District Court, Seattle but was not charged. The arrest was made public in 2016 during Heard's divorce proceedings from actor Johnny Depp. A statement was then issued by Heard's publicist in which van Ree said that Heard had been \\\"wrongfully\\\" accused and that the incident had been \\\"misinterpreted and over-sensationalized\\\", while also recalling \\\"hints of misogynistic attitudes toward us which later appeared to be homophobic when they found out we were domestic partners and not just 'friends'\\\" and adding that she and Heard \\\"shared 5 wonderful years together and remain close to this day\\\". The female officer who conducted the arrest \\u2014 a lesbian \\u2014 subsequently posted on Facebook to say, \\\"I am so not homophobic or misogynistic! The arrest was made because an assault occurred (I witnessed it).\\\"\\nHeard was one of the victims of the 2014 celebrity nude photo leak, in which \\\"more than 50 of [her] personal photos were stolen and released to the public\\\" with Heard later both speaking and writing against such breaches of privacy.\\nFollowing her divorce from Johnny Depp, Heard dated tech entrepreneur and Tesla CEO and shareholder Elon Musk for a year, until early 2018. She later had a relationship with actress and cinematographer Bianca Butti from January 2020 to December 2021.\\nIn April 2021, Heard had her first child, a daughter, via surrogacy. In December 2024, Heard announced that she is expecting her second child. On May 11, 2025, Heard announced the arrival of twins, a daughter and son. As of June 2023, Heard resides in Madrid, Spain.\\n\\nRelationship with Johnny Depp\\nHeard first met actor Johnny Depp in 2009 when she was cast in The Rum Diary opposite him. According to reports, the couple began dating in 2012 and were married in a civil ceremony in February 2015.\\n\\nAustralian customs incident\\nIn April 2015, Heard and Depp breached Australia's biosecurity laws when they failed to declare in customs the two dogs accompanying them when they flew into Queensland, where Depp was working on Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. In May 2015, the dogs were flown out of the country hours before a euthanasia deadline. Later in July of the same year, only Heard was charged for this breach in the laws.\\nBy December 2015, the case had been adjourned four times with Heard having instructed her lawyers to enter not guilty pleas and stating that she was \\\"looking forward\\\" to fighting the charges. In the court case in April 2016, Heard pleaded guilty to falsifying quarantine documents, stating that she had made a mistake due to sleep deprivation. While criminal charges were dropped, she was placed on a A$1,000 (US$752) one-month good behaviour bond for producing a false document; Heard and Depp released a video apologizing for their behavior and urging others to adhere to biosecurity laws.\\n\\nDivorce\\nHeard filed for divorce from Depp in May 2016 and obtained a temporary restraining order against him, releasing a statement saying that, \\\"During the entirety of our relationship, Johnny has been verbally and physically abusive to me. I endured excessive emotional, verbal and physical abuse from Johnny, which has included angry, hostile, humiliating and threatening assaults to me whenever I questioned his authority or disagreed with him.\\\" She requested $50,000 a month \\\"as and for pendente lite spousal support based on [their] marital lifestyle\\\". In response, Depp's counsel said \\\"Amber is attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse\\\", but agreed with her request for a restraining order, saying Depp \\\"nonetheless has every intention of staying away from Amber and will stipulate to mutual stay-away and personal conduct orders\\\".\\nA settlement amount for the divorce was arrived at in August 2016, and Heard pledged to donate the proceeds equally between the ACLU and CHLA. She dropped her request for a continued restraining order and she and Depp issued a joint statement saying that their \\\"relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm.\\\"\\nThe final terms of the settlement were agreed upon by January 2017 with Depp being required to complete the payment of $7 million to Heard by February 2018, contribute $500,000 towards Heard's attorneys fees, and to give Heard custody of their two dogs, a horse, and two cars. Depp was to retain all his real estate assets and 42 vehicles and no spousal support would be paid by either party. In her 2022 testimony, Heard stated that because they had no pre-nuptial agreement, she would have been entitled to half of Depp's earnings of $65 million during the marriage had she requested it.\\n\\nDepp v News Group Newspapers Ltd\\nIn June 2018, Depp brought a libel lawsuit in the United Kingdom against News Group Newspapers (NGN), the company publishing The Sun, which had labeled him a \\\"wife beater\\\" in an April 2018 article. Heard was a key witness for NGN during the highly publicized trial in July 2020.\\nIn November 2020, the presiding judge found that Depp had lost his claim and that \\\"the great majority of alleged assaults of Ms Heard by Mr Depp [12 out of the 14] have been proved to the civil standard\\\". The court rejected Depp's claim of a hoax, and accepted that the allegations Heard had made against Depp had damaged her career and activism. Depp's appeal to overturn the verdict was rejected in March 2021.\\n\\nDepp v. Heard\\nIn February 2019, Depp sued Heard for defamation over a December 2018 op-ed for The Washington Post. In the lawsuit, Depp alleged that the op-ed contained three defamatory statements, the first of which was a headline:\\n\\n\\\"Amber Heard: I spoke up against sexual violence \\u2014 and faced our culture's wrath. That has to change.\\\"\\n\\\"Then two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture's wrath for women who speak out.\\\"\\n\\\"I had the rare vantage point of seeing, in real time, how institutions protect men accused of abuse.\\\"\\nDepp also alleged that Heard had been the one who abused him, and that her allegations constituted a hoax against him.\\nIn August 2020, Heard filed a counterclaim against Depp, alleging that he had coordinated \\\"a harassment campaign via Twitter and [by] orchestrating online petitions to get her fired from Aquaman and L'Or\\u00e9al\\\". Ultimately, Heard's counterclaim went to trial over three allegations that Depp had defamed her through statements made by his then-lawyer, Adam Waldman, published in the Daily Mail in April 2020, where Waldman stated:\\n\\n\\\"Heard and her friends in the media used fake sexual violence allegations as both sword and shield\\\", publicizing a \\\"sexual violence hoax\\\" against Depp.\\n... in one incident at a penthouse, \\\"Amber and her friends spilled a little wine and roughed the place up, got their stories straight under the direction of a lawyer and publicist, and then placed a second call to 911\\\" as \\\"an ambush, a hoax\\\" against Depp.\\n... there had been an \\\"abuse hoax\\\" by Heard against Depp.\\nThe Depp-Heard trial took place in Fairfax County, Virginia between April 11 and June 1, 2022. The verdict was that for Depp's lawsuit, the jury found that all three statements from Heard's op-ed were false, defamed Depp, and were made with actual malice, so the jury awarded Depp $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages from Heard. The punitive damages were reduced to $350,000 due to a limit imposed by Virginia state law. For Heard's counterclaim, the jury found that Waldman's first and third statements to the Daily Mail had not been proven to be defamatory, while finding that Waldman's second statement to the Daily Mail was false, defamatory and made with actual malice. As a result, Heard was awarded $2 million in compensatory damages and zero in punitive damages from Depp.\\nDuring the trial, online public sentiment was generally against Heard. Her testimony, which was widely ridiculed, was thought to be false. Heard said she was \\\"harassed, humiliated, threatened every single day\\\" and described online criticism of her testimony as \\\"agonizing\\\". An interviewer hypothesized that the jury had reviewed the evidence and had not believed Heard's testimony and Heard responded to this by questioning how the jury could have believed her by the time she got on the stand when they had already listened \\\"to three-and-a-half weeks of testimony about how I was a non-credible person\\\".\\nThe day after the verdict was read, Heard's lawyer, Elaine Bredehoft, told interviewers that Heard could not afford to pay the damages owed to Depp and would appeal the verdict. A month later, one of Heard's insurance providers, New York Marine, sued Heard in federal court, wanting to avoid paying up to $1 million for her legal defense fees in the Virginia case, arguing that the \\\"jury's factual findings establish that Heard's liability is caused by the willful act(s) of Heard\\\", hence New York Marine is \\\"not liable\\\" for the loss.\\nAfter they both filed to appeal the verdict, Depp and Heard settled the case in December 2022, with Heard publicly stating that even if her appeal succeeds, she \\\"simply cannot go through\\\" a retrial, while maintaining that the settlement was \\\"not an act of concession\\\". Meanwhile, Depp's lawyers stated that the \\\"jury's unanimous decision and the resulting judgement in Mr. Depp's favor against Ms. Heard remain fully in place\\\", and that the settlement would result in $1 million being paid to Depp by Heard's insurer, which \\\"Depp is pledging and will donate to charities\\\".\\n\\nFilmography\\nFilm\\nTelevision\\nMusic videos\\nAwards and nominations\\nNotes\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\n\\nAmber Heard at IMDb \\nAmber Heard at the TCM Movie Database \\nAmber Heard on Twitter\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"distances\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.3985528550587417,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.3245055280446698,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.3102100890491646,\n          1.137369444268302,\n          1.2484029748734402\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
